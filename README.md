Western ART
During the last few months four of our doctoral students, Anu, Bihan,
Rahul, and Sweta from the discipline of Fine Arts, nurtured a hundred of
talented BTech students to explore their creativity, artistic perspectives
and thoughts through visual art forms. The outcome of the novel effort is
now ready to be presented before you.
The entire session is hosted by the Approach Cell and will be open from
8th to 10th November.
Step in, explore, encourage our students and let the art spark your
imagination and curiosity. Donâ€™t miss this chance to connect with art
created right here, by students like you!
See you all at the APPROACH Exhibition Hall near Gate number 2 (Academic
Area)
